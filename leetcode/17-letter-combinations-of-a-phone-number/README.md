# Solutions

## BFS
Use an array to store the letter combinations as of the current digit. Add next digit by iterating and append letters to all the exsiting combinations.

**Complexity Analysis**:
1. Time Complexity: `O(4^n)`. We need get all the combinations;
1. Space Complexity: `O(4^n)`. An array is needed to store all the combinations.
